                <h2>Instructions/Descriptions</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    In a 6-qt. stockpot, heat butter over medium heat; saute
                    onion and garlic until tender, 6-8 minutes. Stir in
                    broccoli, carrot, stock, cream and seasonings; bring to a
                    boil. Simmer, uncovered, until vegetables are tender, 10-12
                    minutes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Mix cornstarch and water until smooth; stir into soup. Bring
                    to a boil, stirring occasionally; cook and stir until
                    thickened, 1-2 minutes. Remove bay leaves. Stir in cheese
                    until melted.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If using bread bowls, cut a slice off the top of each bread
                    loaf; hollow out bottoms, leaving 1/4-in.-thick shells (save
                    removed bread for another use). Fill with soup just before
                    serving.
                  </li>
                  <li>Serve soup with toppings as desired.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Tips</h3>
                These make for a hearty meal on their own but are also delicious
                as appetizers. Smaller, sturdy breads such as hard rolls are a
                good choice.
